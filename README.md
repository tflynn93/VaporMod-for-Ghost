# VaporMod for Ghost

*VaporMod for Ghost* is a [Ghost](http://ghost.org/) theme for my [blog](http://blog.timflynn.info) that is a slightly modified version of [**Vapor**](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor) by [Seth Lilly](https://github.com/sethlilly).

Description of **Vapor** from Seth Lilly
>Minimal and responsive with a focus on typography, **Vapor** is a theme that embodies the core concept of >[Ghost](http://ghost.org/)&mdash;it fades into the background, bringing the focus to your content.
>
>Supports blog and user images; cover images, while supported in the Ghost admin, are not displayed in the theme due totheme's >minimal nature and focus on typography.
>
>Fonts embedded via Google Fonts, including Roboto Slab, Merriweather, and Open Sans Condensed.
>
>The Ghost, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ icons are trademarks of their respective owners and are from the Casper theme, >copyright (c) 2013 Ghost Foundation and released under The MIT License.

## My Modifications

I've changed around a few things from the original theme to make it my own a bit.  
* Added social media icons to the header of the page using [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)
* Changed around a bit of the CSS that handles images and margins in a few places
* Adjusted font color to straight black (#000000)
* Justified text
* Changed wording in the footer
* Added Google Analytics for myself
* Added support for colorful task bars in Androd Lollipop (see post [here](http://blog.timflynn.info/custom-header-and-taskbar-colors-for-chrome-on-lollipop/))
